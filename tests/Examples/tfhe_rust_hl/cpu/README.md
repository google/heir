# End to end Rust codegen tests - Boolean

These tests exercise Rust codegen for the
[tfhe-rs](https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs) backend library, including
compiling the generated Rust source and running the resulting binary. This sets
tests are specifically of the boolean plaintexts and the accompanying library.

The tests are generated using a custom Bazel macro found in
[test.bzl](tests/Examples/tfhe_rust/test.bzl). `tfhe-rs` is added a
project-level dependency, and it's version is pinned in
[MODULE.bazel](MODULE.bazel).
