An MLIR-based toolchain for
[homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption)
compilers. Read the docs at [the HEIR website](https://heir.dev).

## Contributing

There are many ways to contribute to HEIR:

- Come to our [twice-monthly meetings](https://heir.dev/community/) to discuss
  active work on HEIR and future project directions. The meetings are recorded
  and posted to our [blog](https://heir.dev/blog/)
- Work on an issue marked
  ["good first issue"](https://github.com/google/heir/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
  or browse issues [labeled by topic](https://github.com/google/heir/labels).
- Tell us about what you'd like to use HEIR for in an
  [offline discussion thread](https://github.com/google/heir/discussions).
- Help us understand new FHE research: either
  - Read a paper tagged under
    [research synthesis](https://github.com/google/heir/labels/research%20synthesis)
    and summarize the novel techniques that could be ported to HEIR.
  - File new issues under
    [research synthesis](https://github.com/google/heir/labels/research%20synthesis)
    to alert us of papers that should be investigated and incorporated into
    HEIR.
