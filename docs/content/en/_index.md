## What is HEIR?

HEIR is a compiler toolchain for
[fully homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption)
(FHE). We aim to standardize a set of intermediate representations related to
FHE, which compiler engineers, hardware designers, and cryptography researchers
can build upon to accelerate the research and development of production-strength
privacy-first software systems.

HEIR is built in the [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) framework.

For an overview of the project's goals, see [our talk at
FHE.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqDFdKUTNA4).

To see the dialects and possible flows, take a look at the diagram below:

## Project Goals

-   Provide MLIR dialects for all modern FHE schemes.
-   Design MLIR dialects that appropriately abstract across the many flavors of
    related schemes.
-   Design lower-level dialects for optimizing underlying abstract-algebraic
    operations (e.g., modular polynomial arithmetic).
-   Provide hardware accelerator designers an easy path to integrate, so that a
    wide variety of FHE programs, optimizations, and parameter choices can be
    compared across accelerators.
-   Provide a platform for research into novel FHE optimizations.
-   Provide a platform for benchmarking.
-   Provide integrations with multiple front-end languages, such as ClangIR and
    TensorFlow.
